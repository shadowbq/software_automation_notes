Basically it boils down to this: if you want to use chocopkgup privately, you will need to pay for it. As long as you are publishing to chocolatey.org, the tool is completely free! The license does expire every once in awhile, but if you are keeping up on your chocolatey updates locally, you won't even notice (cup all, remember?).
